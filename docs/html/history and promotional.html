<h1>Promote mozhunt</h1>

<p>Want to get some extra information about mozhunt without all the story lines weaved into the site? Want to help promote mozhunt and get the word out? Well then you have come to the right place! This page holds a collection of promotional materials for use in blog posts, and other articles, as well as behind the scenes information.</p>

<h2>So what is the real story behind mozhunt?</h2>

<p>Well mozhunt, (originally known as &ldquo;that easter egg hunt thing&rdquo;) was run by William &ldquo;FuzzyFox&rdquo; Duyck, a Mozilla community member. It was a volunteer project to help add some fun into the Mozilla community online, as well as get more information out about more things that were going on around the Mozilla ecosystem. The end result? A highly addictive game that made some people miss classes and sleep.</p>

<p>Since the original version of the game the project has now been expanded several times. The first time round was a more refined idea and implementation of the same game, but this time run in conjunction with the Firefox 3.5 launch (still as a community run game). There was less interruption to the players which meant that people could spend more time looking for news, blogposts, and more around the Mozilla ecosystem that might be hiding the tokens used at the time (pandas), and less time filling in forms and clicking buttons.</p>

<p>The name was gained a short while after the initial run as an easter egg hunt. It originated in the mind of one <a href="http://twitter.com/jruderman">Jesse Ruderman</a> as a nice little hashtag to use to help promote the game, and it just sort of stuck.</p>

<h2>When was the last time this happened?</h2>

<p>Well… it is hard to pin an exact date on it, due to the running of some smaller instances of the game, however the last &ldquo;mozhunt&rdquo; run was in 2009 during the Firefox 3.5 release party season. It consisted of a total of 21 hidden pandas. The winner (going by the handle of jeff_themovie) was the winner with a respectable 13 pandas found. Jeff (as we shall now refer to him), was not left unrewarded either. He was lucy enough to be sent a one off, limited edition mozhunt t-shirt along with a bag full of Mozilla goodies.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s new since the last time?</h2>

<p>This time all the stops have been pulled out. It is more than just a single person hacking on a big messy block of code in their spare time, and is now a collection of people hacking on a big, not so messy block of code in their spare time. The new version of mozhunt no only runs on a completely rewritten codebase, but also has the advantage of multiple developers, a small group of marketeers, and an amazing artist.</p>

<h2>So who do we thank this time?</h2>

<p>Since the last time the state of the project has changed slightly as indicated in the previous section. We now have a team of 3 developers, including William who developed the game originally. A handful of marketeers, and one very talented artist. So without further ado, or further delay. The mozhunt team:</p>

<ul>
<li>William Duyck</li>
<li>Steve West</li>
<li>Joe Harrison</li>
<li>Aishling Mulhern</li>
<li>Majken Connor</li>
<li>Leo McArdle</li>
</ul>


<h2>Promotional Materials</h2>

<p>Okay… enough boring text to read through. Time for a few visual goodies.</p>
