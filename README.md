## What is mozhunt?
Well mozhunt was originally a community developed, community run, treasure hunt on the web for the mozilla community. It was a big success and now it is finally time to dust it off and recreate it.

## So how does it work?
There are two parts to the game... first of all there are those hiding tokens. The idea is that this is a quick and simple a process as possible. All the hider need do is paste one or two lines of code onto their site and instantly their token is hidden. They can also add a cryptic clue as to what their site is and where on the site their token is hidden.
For the players this is a little different, they visit as many sites around the mozilla community (and any other sites where tokens are hidden) to find these tokens.
Now you should not need a separate account to hide and find tokens. HOWEVER those hiding tokens may not add the one they have hidden to their site.
