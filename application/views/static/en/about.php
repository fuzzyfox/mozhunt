				<h1>History</h1>
				<h2>So what is the real story behind mozhunt?</h2>
				<p>Well mozhunt, (originally known as &ldquo;that easter egg hunt
				thing&rdquo;) was run by William &ldquo;FuzzyFox&rdquo; Duyck, a
				Mozilla community member. It was a volunteer project to help add
				some fun into the Mozilla community online, as well as get more
				information out about more things that were going on around the
				Mozilla ecosystem. The end result? A highly addictive game that
				made some people miss classes and sleep.</p>
				<p>Since the original version of the game the project has now been
				expanded several times. The first time round was a more refined
				idea and implementation of the same game, but this time run in
				conjunction with the Firefox 3.5 launch (still as a community run
				game). There was less interruption to the players which meant that
				people could spend more time looking for news, blogposts, and more
				around the Mozilla ecosystem that might be hiding the tokens used
				at the time (pandas), and less time filling in forms and clicking
				buttons.</p>
				<p>The name was gained a short while after the initial run as an
				easter egg hunt. It originated in the mind of one
				<a href="http://twitter.com/jruderman">Jesse Ruderman</a> as a nice
				little hashtag to use to help promote the game, and it just sort
				of stuck.</p>
				
				<h2>When was the last time this happened?</h2>
				<p>Well&hellip; it is hard to pin an exact date on it, due to the running 
				of some smaller instances of the game, however the last
				&ldquo;mozhunt&rdquo; run was in 2009 during the Firefox 3.5 release
				party season. It consisted of a total of 21 hidden pandas. The winner
				(going by the handle of jeff_themovie) was the winner with a
				respectable 13 pandas found. Jeff (as we shall now refer to him),
				was not left unrewarded either. He was lucy enough to be sent a
				one off, limited edition mozhunt t-shirt, along with a bag full of
				Mozilla goodies.</p>
				
				<h2>What&rsquo;s new since the last time?</h2>
				<p>This time all the stops have been pulled out. It is more than
				just a single person hacking on a big messy block of code in their
				spare time, and is now a collection of people hacking on a big,
				not so messy block of code in their spare time. The new version
				of mozhunt no only runs on a completely rewritten codebase, but
				also has the advantage of multiple developers, a small group of
				marketeers, and an amazing artist.</p>
				
				<h2>So who do we thank this time?</h2>
				<p>Since the last time the state of the project has changed slightly
				as indicated in the previous section. We now have a team of 3
				developers, including William who developed the game originally.
				A handful of marketeers, and one very talented artist. So without
				further ado, or further delay. The mozhunt team:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>William Duyck</li>
					<li>Steve West</li>
					<li>Joe Harrison</li>
					<li>Aishling Mulhern</li>
					<li>Majken Connor</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>The Rules</h1>
				<p>Okay, so mozhunt, being a game, has rules. What kind of game
				doesn&rsquo;t? First one of which is no cheating, unless you plan
				on getting a high score and no prize :D</p>
				
				<h2>The aim of the game</h2>
				<p>Simple as pie this one&hellip; find the easter eggs!</p>
				<p>Okay&hellip; we will give you a little more than that. So hidden on
				a collection of websites around the Mozilla ecosystem you will
				find easter eggs that look a little like this:</p>
				
				<img src="" alt="insert image of easter eggs here" class="center">
				
				<p>Whenever you encounter one of these easter eggs there is one
				simple thing you need to do in order to add it to your score. Give
				it a click! <strong>However</strong> should you see an easter egg
				like one of these:</p>
				
				<img src="" alt="insert image of found easter eggs">
				
				<p>Then there is no need to click it. You have already found it&hellip;
				time to look for the rest!</p>
				
				<h2>Things not to do</h2>
				<p>There are lot of things we encourage you to do while playing
				the game. First of which is to read through the site you find easter
				eggs on. However to ensure not only a fair game, but also that those
				really trying their best, we have some things that you may not do
				during gameplay. Doing so will result in the loss of your account
				as well as a disadvantage to other players as we may be forced to
				remove easter eggs from them too.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Under no circumstances can you reveal the location of any
					easter eggs you find.</li>
					<li>You may not collect the same easter eggs twice (and we will
					do what we can to prevent you doing so).</li>
					<li>You can only have one mozhunt account.</li>
					<li>Those hiding easter eggs may not tell anyone where it is hidden.</li>
					<li>If hiding an easter egg it you may not add it to your collection.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Its not all doom and gloom though!</p>
				
				<h2>Things you should do</h2>
				<p>As we already mentioned we encourage you to read through the
				site you find easter eggs on, but there is more!</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Read and explore the website you find easter eggs on.</li>
					<li>Seek out as many tokens as possible.</li>
					<li>Continue to attend school/work/college/lectures/etc&hellip;
					as normal. (We know some people didn&rsquo;t last time!)</li>
					<li>Eat, sleep and drink! You need to stay alert and clear minded
					if you have any chance of finding them all.</li>
					<li>No trying to eat the easter eggs. They are just pictures
					on your screen&hellip; Digital devices don&rsquo;t tend to taste
					all that good :P</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>So what are you waiting for?! Go on and join in with the fun!
