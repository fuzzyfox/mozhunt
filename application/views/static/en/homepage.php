	<p>The one and only, cross domain treasure hunt is back, and this time
	its all about them easter eggs! With just a few days to go we are looking
	for those who think they have what it takes to hide easter eggs, and hide
	them well. So... do you think you have what it takes?</p>
	<p class="alert alert-block clearfix">Sorry about the delay in the launch of mozhunt...
	please follow us on twitter to get the latest news. Current plans are to fix
	the problems we have encountered by the end of Thursday 6th, April 2012 GMT.<br>
