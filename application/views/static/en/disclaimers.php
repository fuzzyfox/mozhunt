				<h2>JavaScript Libraries</h2>
				<h3>jQuery (v 1.6.2)</h3>
				<a href="//jquery.com">www.jquery.com</a>
				<img src="asset/img/logo/jQuery.png" alt="jQuery Logo" class="right" style="max-height:100px" />
				<p>jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies
				HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax
				interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change
				the way that you write JavaScript, and has helped us speed up the
				development of this project massively.</p>
				
				<h2 class="clear">PHP Libraries</h2>
				<h3>CodeIgniter (v 2.1.0)</h3>
				<a href="//codeigniter.com">www.codeigniter.com</a>
				<img src="asset/img/logo/CodeIgniter.png" alt="CodeIgniter Logo" class="left" style="max-height:100px" />
				<p>CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint,
				built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create
				full-featured web applications. If you're a developer who lives in
				the real world of shared hosting accounts and clients with deadlines,
				and if you're tired of ponderously large and thoroughly undocumented
				frameworks.</p>
				<p>We have used CodeIgniter again to help cut the development time
				for this project but also so that we have a nice solid, and secure
				basis from which to begin working on.</p>
				
				<h2 class="clear">Other</h2>
				<h3>html5boilerplate (v 2.0)</h3>
				<a href="//html5boilerplate.com">www.html5boilerplate.com</a>
				<img src="asset/img/logo/html5bolierplate.png" alt="html5boilerplate Logo" class="right" style="max-height:100px" />
				<p>HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional badass's base HTML/CSS/JS
				template for a fast, robust and future-safe site.</p>
				<p>After more than three years in iterative development, you get
				the best of the best practices baked in: cross-browser normalization,
				performance optimizations, even optional features like cross-domain
				Ajax and Flash. A starter apache .htaccess config file hooks you
				the eff up with caching rules and preps your site to serve HTML5
				video, use @font-face, and get your gzip zipple on.</p>
				<p>Boilerplate is not a framework, nor does it prescribe any philosophy
				of development, it's just got some tricks to get your project off
				the ground quickly and right-footed.</p>
